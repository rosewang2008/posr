Math problems:
{problems}

Please output the first line index and last line index of each segment, along with the ID of the problem discussed in each segment as a list of JSON objects: [{"start_line_index": <first line index of segment 1>, "end_line_index": <last line index of segment 1>, "problem_id": <ID of problem discussed in segment 1>}, ... {"start_line_index": <first line index of segment n>, "end_line_index": <last line index of segment n>, "problem_id": <ID of problem discussed in segment n>}]. If a math problem was discussed in a segment but not found in the provided set of problems, let the problem_id be -1. Only output the list of JSON objects. Do not output any additional text or explanations.
