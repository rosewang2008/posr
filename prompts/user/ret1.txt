Please read the segmented transcript, read the set of math problems that might be discussed in each segment, and determine the math problem that was discussed in each segment, if any.

Segment:
{transcript}

Math problems:
{problems}

Please output the ID of the problem discussed in each segment as a list of JSON objects: [{"segment_id": <segment ID>, "problem_id": <problem ID>}, ...]. If no math problem was discussed in a segment, let the problem ID be null. If a math problem was discussed in a segment but not found in the provided set of problems, let the problem ID be -1. Only output a list of JSON objects. Do not output any additional text or explanations.
