Near the end of a US cable news show, the host
invited viewers to respond to a poll on the show’s
website that asked, “Do you support the new federal
policy discussed during the show?” At the end of the
show, the host reported that 28% responded “Yes,”
and 70% responded “No.” Which of the following
best explains why the results are unlikely to represent
the sentiments of the population of the United
States?

A) The percentages do not add up to 100%, so any
possible conclusions from the poll are invalid.

B) Those who responded to the poll were not a
random sample of the population of the
United States.

C) There were not 50% “Yes” responses and 50%
“No” responses.

D) The show did not allow viewers enough time to
respond to the poll.
