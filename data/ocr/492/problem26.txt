Keith modeled the growth over several hundred
years of a tree population by estimating the number
of the trees’ pollen grains per square centimeter that
were deposited each year within layers of a lake’s
sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains
per square centimeter the first year the grains were
deposited, with a 1% annual increase in the number
of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of
the following functions models P(t), the number of
pollen grains per square centimeter t years after the
first year the grains were deposited?

A) P(t) =310°

B) P(t) =310!°!
C) P(t) = 310(0.99)
D) P(t) = 310(1.01)'
