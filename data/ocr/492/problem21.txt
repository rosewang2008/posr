0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)

Clayton will mix x milliliters of a 10% by mass saline
solution with y milliliters of a 20% by mass saline
solution in order to create an 18% by mass saline
solution. The equation above represents this
situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the 20% by
mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the 10%
by mass saline solution must he use?

A) 5
B) 25
C) 50
