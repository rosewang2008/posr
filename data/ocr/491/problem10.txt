A researcher surveyed a random sample of students
from a large university about how often they see
movies. Using the sample data, the researcher
estimated that 23% of the students in the population
saw a movie at least once per month. The margin of
error for this estimation is 4%. Which of the
following is the most appropriate conclusion about
all students at the university, based on the given
estimate and margin of error?

A) Itis unlikely that less than 23% of the students
see a movie at least once per month.

B) Atleast 23%, but no more than 25%, of the
students see a movie at least once per month.

C) The researcher is between 19% and 27% sure
that most students see a movie at least once per
month.

D) Itis plausible that the percentage of students
who see a movie at least once per month is
between 19% and 27%.
