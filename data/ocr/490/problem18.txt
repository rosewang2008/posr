Juan purchased an antique that had a value of $200
at the time of purchase. Each year, the value of the
antique is estimated to increase 10% over its value
the previous year. The estimated value of the antique,
in dollars, 2 years after purchase can be represented
by the expression 200a, where a is a constant. What
is the value of a?
