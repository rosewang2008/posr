a)

T=5e+12f

A manufacturer shipped units of a certain product to
two locations. The equation above shows the total
shipping cost T, in dollars, for shipping c units to the
closer location and shipping f units to the farther
location. If the total shipping cost was $47,000 and
3000 units were shipped to the farther location, how
many units were shipped to the closer location?
