,,,"So the sat has no guessing penalty. So answer every question, even if you don't know the answer at all. So when useful strategy is to guess the same letter each time. And this is good for when you're out of time or completely stuff.",2023-02-16T15:00:31.260-08:00,2023-02-16T15:00:45.840-08:00,tutor,tutor,1,,,

,,,"So this means to focus on the easy questions. First maximize points instead of focusing all of your time on the hard questions, and not having enough time to answer all of the questions. So don't be afraid to skip problems and come back",2023-02-16T15:01:09.750-08:00,2023-02-16T15:01:24.200-08:00,tutor,tutor,1,,,

,,,and typically the sections will increase in difficulty as you g0 0n. So the easiest questions will usually be the early multiple choice questions and the first few grid,2023-02-16T15:02:03.120-08:00,2023-02-16T15:02:13.570-08:00,tutor,tutor,1,,,

,,,"and you can also use the answers and plug them into the question and see if they make sense or solve the problem.
