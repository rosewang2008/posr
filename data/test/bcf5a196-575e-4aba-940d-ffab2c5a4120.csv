,,,"and what that means is you can first go, go, answer the questions that you know immediately how to answer after reading the question, and if for the question the seem harder or longer, you can leave them to the end, because the sat doesn't prevent you from skipping a question and going back to it.",2023-02-15T16:40:37.690-08:00,2023-02-15T16:40:55.380-08:00,tutor,tutor,1,,,
